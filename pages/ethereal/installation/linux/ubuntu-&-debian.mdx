## MongoDB Localhost Setup 
- This is if you are not using MongoDB Atlas if you want to use that go to [MongoDB Atlas!](/spacebot/installation/mongodb-atlas) 

## Spacebot!

- Open the ftp app ex: FileZilla, and import the extracted spacebot folder to your server
- Once completed CD into the folder Ex: I put my spacebot into the root of the user 
```
webserver@webserver:~$ ls -l
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 3 webserver webserver 4096 Apr 13 21:48 spacebotv14
````
My user is webserver so you see spacebotv14 there I would just run the command `cd spacebotv14`
- Next config your .env file by running `sudo nano .env`

```js filename=".env" {3} copy
token = TOKEN # Place Token Here 
MONGODBURL = mongodb://localhost:27017/spacebot # Place MongoDB Url Here
(line(s) 1-2)
```
- Once configured run `npm i` 
- Once npm is finished run the bot with node .
This should be the output: 
```
webserver@webserver:~/spacebotv14$ node .
Started refreshing application (/) commands.
Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.
Ready!
```
- To keep the bot running after you close the terminal run `nohup node . &` then type `exit` and it should close your ssh session
